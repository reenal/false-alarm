# false-alarm
This repo is machine lerning project we have created to solve below problem
problem statemnet :
This project was made for a chemical industry which had sensors installed in various parts of the factory to detect H2S gas which is hazardous to health. Every time one or multiple sensors detected the H2S leak, an emergency alarm rings to alert the workers. For every alarm, the industry calls a team which sanitizes the place and checks for the leak and this was a big cost to the company. A few of the alarms that ring are not even hazardous. The company gave us the data for each alarm with a final column stating the alarm was dangerous or not.
